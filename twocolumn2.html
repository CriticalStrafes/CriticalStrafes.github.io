								<h2>Latest News and Products of Microsoft.</h2>
								<p>New Products have been realised and teasers have been realised. New products that are out are Microsoft band 2 and surface pro all new products are basically new versions of their old products.</p>
								<p>One Product I want talk about is The Micrososft Hololens which are big glasses which use holographic things and is good for work and can used and has been out for a long time (prototype) But it has been a worldwide attraction and has caught many peoples attention and many people are waiting for it.</p>
								<p>It’s been an incredible year for the data business at Microsoft and an incredible year for data across the industry. This Thursday at our Data Driven event in New York, we will kick off a wave of launch activities for SQL Server 2016 with general availability later this year. This is the most significant release of SQL Server that we have ever done, and brings with it some fantastic new capabilities. SQL Server 2016 delivers:
Groundbreaking security encryption capabilities that enable data to always be encrypted at rest, in motion and in-memory to deliver maximum security protection
In-memory database support for every workload with performance increases up to 30-100x
Incredible Data Warehousing performance with the #1, #2 and #3 TPC-H 10 Terabyte benchmarks for non-clustered performance, and the #1 SAP SD Two-Tier performance benchmark on windows
Business Intelligence for every employee on every device – including new mobile BI support for iOS, Android and Windows Phone devices
Advanced analytics using our new R support that enables customers to do real-time predictive analytics on both operational and analytic data
Unique cloud capabilities that enable customers to deploy hybrid architectures that partition data workloads across on-premises and cloud based systems to save costs and increase agility
