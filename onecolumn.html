								<h2>Coolest Products over the years</h2>
								<p>Wondering about the coolest products over the year????? Well Here is my opinion of the coolest products over the years well I will list it off `</p>
								<p>The Arc Touch Mouse is one of Microsoft's excellently designed accessories. It curves for use and flattens for storage making the mouse easy to transport. The Arc features a Bluetooth connection, long battery life, and precision scrolling. Because of the Arc's stylish design it has won many awards and accolades. The original Xbox proved that Microsoft could create hardware and appeal to gamers. Besides having exclusive titles like Halo, the original Xbox also introduced gamers to Xbox Live, which let gamers play against each other online. The Xbox kicked off what it today one of the most successful divisions in Microsoft today. </p>
								<p>Office is one of Microsoft's most useful and popular products. Besides being an excellent productivity application, Office is extremely easy to develop for remains the go to productivity suite because any attempt to topple Office means declaring war on the army of in-house and third-party developers who have built their livelihoods around the suite's expanding library of automation and integration APIs.In the meantime, we're eagerly waiting for Microsoft Office to finally hit tablets on Windows 8 and the iPad. The Xbox 360 built upon the success of the original Xbox. Xbox 360 competed directly with the Playstation 3 and stood its ground. As of April 2012 there have been 67.2 million Xbox 360s sold. game system introduced more storage, faster performance, and wireless controllers.In addition the Kinect, which was introduced in 2000, has been hugely successful.
